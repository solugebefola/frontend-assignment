# Timescale Frontend Interview Assignment

My submission for Timescale's front-end interview. The task was completed slightly under 4 hours.
A new folder structure was constructed to improve readability and navigation. Includes proptypes,
all required functionality, and added .env to .gitignore

### Goals

The main features that should be implemented
✔️ - On the initial visit to the site, it will show the most recent movies

### TODOs
